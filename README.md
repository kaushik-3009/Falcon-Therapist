# Falcon Therapist

This project introduces a mental health therapy chatbot powered by a fine-tuned version of the Falcon 7B large language model.  The chatbot aims to provide accessible and empathetic mental health support through a conversational interface.

## Abstract

Access to mental healthcare remains a significant challenge for many.  This project addresses this issue by developing a chatbot that leverages the power of natural language processing to offer support, coping strategies, and information to those struggling with mental health concerns.  The chatbot is not intended to replace professional help but to serve as a supplementary tool for early intervention and support.

## System Design

* **Model:** Falcon 7B instruct fine-tuned using qLora.
* **Dataset:** Therapist-patient conversation transcripts and academic texts in psychology.
* **Fine-tuning Method:**  qLora is used to adapt the Falcon 7B model to the specific nuances of mental health conversations, enhancing context relevance and empathy.
* **Deployment:** Gradio live server for a user-friendly web-based interface.

## Implementation

The chatbot was implemented using Python and leverages the `transformers` and `gradio` libraries. The fine-tuning process was managed using qLora.  (Detailed instructions and code will be provided in the repository.)

## Results 

The fine-tuned Falcon 7B model demonstrates significant improvements in response quality and relevance compared to the base model. The chatbot provides more detailed, empathetic, and actionable responses to user queries.

## Future Enhancements

* **Improved Personalization:** Tailoring responses based on user history and preferences.
* **Integration with External Resources:** Connecting users with relevant mental health services and information.
* **Enhanced Safety Measures:**  Developing robust mechanisms for identifying and handling crisis situations.
* **Continuous Learning:**  Implementing feedback loops to continually improve the chatbot's responses and effectiveness.
